Design Implementation

The code is designed to process XML event files, extract specific data fields, store them in a relational database using
Spring Data JPA,and provide a filtered JSON response through a Spring Boot API endpoint.The key components include:

1.Entity Model (TradeEntity):
TradeEntity entity class represents the data structure to be stored in the database. It includes fields for buyer party,
seller party, premium amount, and premium currency.

2. Database Interaction (JPA and Repository):
Spring Data JPA is employed for seamless interaction with the underlying relational database. The TradeRepository
interface extends JpaRepository to provide basic CRUD operations.

3. XML Parsing (XmlParsingService):
The XmlParsingService is responsible for parsing XML files using Java's built-in XML parsing libraries. It extracts data
fields based on pre-defined XPath expressions and dynamically sets them in TradeEntity objects.

4. Filtering Logic (TradeFilterService):
An TradeFilterService is implemented to filter entities stored in database based on specified criteria such as seller
party, premium currency, and anagram checks. Only events meeting all criteria are included in the filtered result.

5. API Endpoint (TradeController):
The Spring Boot API is exposed through an TradeController. It provides HTTP endpoints for creating and retrieving entities.
Entities are stored in the database, and the filtered results are returned in JSON format.

6. Testing
Proper unit testing is conducted to ensure the correctness of the filtering logic. Error handling is implemented to
address exceptions that may occur during XML parsing or database operations.

7. Scalability and Maintainability:
The code is designed with future scalability and maintainability in mind. Criteria for filtering events can be easily
extended or modified without affecting existing filters. Configuration options are externalized for flexibility.

This design and implementation offer a robust solution for processing XML event data, making it accessible and filterable
via a well-documented API endpoint. It balances maintainability and performance while considering future flexibility and
scalability requirements.
